# Roulette_simulation

In March, my friend and I went to Las Vegas and played Roulette in the casino at a hotel on strip. We observerd that there were 13 reds appeared in a row and the difference of percentage between red and black was about 20%. I was very surprised to see this and therefore I kept betting for black but unfortunately I lost all my money.

I was very angry and I wrote this roulette simulation after I got back home to prove that the casino was cheating.
From my result, in every 40 games, the p-value of consecutive 13 reds is 0.0001. Therefore, I'm 99.9999% sure that what I observed at the casino was not possible. I also computed some other values in my script and all the results show that the casino was cheating.
